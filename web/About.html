	The Online Automation System is a simple and convenient way for client or user to use these features . My project is based on automation and i give name to my project is “Online Automation System”. Where anybody come and these feature in very effective way. First I added three option my project like : Linux , Docker and Vehicle Number Plate Recognize feature. My project is working like if any one click on Linux button he/she will redirected to other page where they use RHEL 8 linux and run all command which is related to linux . It will feel some other experience to use my linux terminal its like without having any OS how all command is running ? Another button is for Docker . Basically docker is a container technology where we can launch any operating system within a second using docker . Docker is an open source platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. Learn about containers, how they compare to VMs, and why Docker is so widely adopted and used. Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers—standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment. Another button for Vehicle number plate recognition. Where client upload his vehicle number plate and retrieve all information using my project like – Owner name , vehicle model , expiring date , vehicle consume diesel or petrol . ANPR performed in controlled lighting conditions with predictable license plate types can use basic image processing techniques.
